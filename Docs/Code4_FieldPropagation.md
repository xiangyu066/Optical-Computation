# Code 4: Field Propagation
This code can provide you with how to calculate the propagating optical field by the Huygensâ€“Fresnel principle from near-field to far-field. Moreover, I raise some common optical problems, such as a single slit and double slits, to simulate the propagating field and you can compare these results with your optical textbooks.
