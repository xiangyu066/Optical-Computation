# Code 5: Field Propagation in the Lens
This code is similar to Code4 which is propagating field in the air. However, the optical field often propagates in the medium such as a lens. Therefore, this code can provide you with how to calculate the propagating optical field through a thin lens, and then I image some simple geometric objects to verify simulation results by magnification.

**Case 1:** In the 1-dim propagating case, the image is twice than original object through a lens, when we set p=75cm, and f=50cm.\
