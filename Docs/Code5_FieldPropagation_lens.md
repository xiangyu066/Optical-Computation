# Code 5: Field Propagation in the Lens
This code can provide you with how to calculate the propagating optical field through a thin lens. Moreover, I raise some common optical problems, such as a single slit and double slits, to simulate the propagating field and you can compare these results with your optics textbooks.

**Case 1:** In the 1-dim propagating case, the image is twice than original object through a lens, when we set p=75cm, and f=50cm.\
